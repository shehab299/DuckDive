       <p class="mathjax">The analysis of time-sequence satellite images is a powerful tool in remote sensing; it is used to explore the statics and dynamics of the surface of the earth. Usually, the quality of multitemporal images is influenced by metrological conditions, high reflectance of surfaces, illumination, and satellite sensor conditions. These negative influences may produce noises and different radiances and appearances between the images, which can affect the applications that process them. Thus, a spatiotemporal bilateral filter has been adopted in this research to enhance the quality of an image before using it in any application. The filter takes advantage of the temporal information provided by multi temporal images and attempts to reduce the differences between them to improve transfer learning used in classification. The classification method used here is support vector machine (SVM). Three experiments were conducted in this research, two were on Landsat 8 images with low-medium resolution, and the third on high-resolution images of Planet satellite. The newly developed filter proved that it can enhance the accuracy of classification using transfer learning by about 5%,15%, and 2% for the three experiments respectively.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In the realm of chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis, radiologists meticulously examine various regions, documenting their observations in reports. The prevalence of errors in CXR diagnoses, particularly among inexperienced radiologists and hospital residents, underscores the importance of understanding radiologists' intentions and the corresponding regions of interest. This understanding is crucial for correcting mistakes by guiding radiologists to the accurate regions of interest, especially in the diagnosis of chest radiograph abnormalities. In response to this imperative, we propose a novel system designed to identify the primary intentions articulated by radiologists in their reports and the corresponding regions of interest in CXR images. This system seeks to elucidate the visual context underlying radiologists' textual findings, with the potential to rectify errors made by less experienced practitioners and direct them to precise regions of interest. Importantly, the proposed system can be instrumental in providing constructive feedback to inexperienced radiologists or junior residents in the hospital, bridging the gap in face-to-face communication. The system represents a valuable tool for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and fostering continuous learning within the medical community.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper aims to introduce a new statistical learning technique based on sparsity promoting for data-driven modeling and control of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. Compared with conventional sparse regression techniques that might introduce computational complexities when the number of candidate functions increases, an innovative algorithm, named adaptive regulated sparse regression (ARSR) is proposed that adaptively regulates the hyperparameter weights of candidate functions to best represent the dynamics of PV systems. Utilizing this algorithm, open-loop and closed-loop models of single-stage and two-stage PV systems are obtained from measurements and are utilized for control design purposes. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed data-driven approach can successfully be employed for fault analysis studies, which distinguishes its capabilities compared with other data-driven techniques. Finally, the proposed approach is validated through real-time simulations.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">4D time-space reconstruction of dynamic events or deforming objects using X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an extremely ill-posed inverse problem. Existing approaches assume that the object remains static for the duration of several tens or hundreds of X-ray projection measurement images (reconstruction of consecutive limited-angle CT scans). However, this is an unrealistic assumption for many in-situ experiments that causes spurious artifacts and inaccurate morphological reconstructions of the object. To solve this problem, we propose to perform a 4D time-space reconstruction using a distributed implicit neural representation (DINR) network that is trained using a novel distributed stochastic training algorithm. Our DINR network learns to reconstruct the object at its output by iterative optimization of its network parameters such that the measured projection images best match the output of the CT forward measurement model. We use a continuous time and space forward measurement model that is a function of the DINR outputs at a sparsely sampled set of continuous valued object coordinates. Unlike existing state-of-the-art neural representation architectures that forward and back propagate through dense voxel grids that sample the object's entire time-space coordinates, we only propagate through the DINR at a small subset of object coordinates in each iteration resulting in an order-of-magnitude reduction in memory and compute for training. DINR leverages distributed computation across several compute nodes and GPUs to produce high-fidelity 4D time-space reconstructions even for extremely large CT data sizes. We use both simulated parallel-beam and experimental cone-beam X-ray CT datasets to demonstrate the superior performance of our approach.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early detection and risk assessment play a crucial role in improving survival rates. Therefore, annual or biennial mammograms are often recommended for screening in high-risk groups. Mammograms are typically interpreted by expert radiologists based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS), which provides a uniform way to describe findings and categorizes them to indicate the level of concern for breast cancer. Recently, machine learning (ML) and computational approaches have been developed to automate and improve the interpretation of mammograms. However, both BI-RADS and the ML-based methods focus on the analysis of data from the present and sometimes the most recent prior visit. While it is clear that temporal changes in image features of the longitudinal scans should carry value for quantifying breast cancer risk, no prior work has conducted a systematic study of this. In this paper, we extend a state-of-the-art ML model to ingest an arbitrary number of longitudinal mammograms and predict future breast cancer risk. On a large-scale dataset, we demonstrate that our model, LoMaR, achieves state-of-the-art performance when presented with only the present mammogram. Furthermore, we use LoMaR to characterize the predictive value of prior visits. Our results show that longer histories (e.g., up to four prior annual mammograms) can significantly boost the accuracy of predicting future breast cancer risk, particularly beyond the short-term. Our code and model weights are available at https://github.com/batuhankmkaraman/LoMaR.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Data-driven controllers design is an important research problem, in particular when data is corrupted by the noise. In this paper, we propose a data-driven min-max model predictive control (MPC) scheme using noisy input-state data for unknown linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The unknown system matrices are characterized by a set-membership representation using the noisy input-state data. Leveraging this representation, we derive an upper bound on the worst-case cost and determine the corresponding optimal state-feedback control law through a semidefinite program (SDP). We prove that the resulting closed-loop system is robustly stabilized and satisfies the input and state constraints. Further, we propose an adaptive data-driven min-max MPC scheme which exploits additional online input-state data to improve closed-loop performance. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Recent developments in low-field (LF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems present remarkable opportunities for affordable and widespread MRI access. A robust denoising method to overcome the intrinsic low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) barrier is critical to the success of LF MRI. However, current data-driven MRI denoising methods predominantly handle magnitude images and rely on customized models with constrained data diversity and quantity, which exhibit limited generalizability in clinical applications across diverse MRI systems, pulse sequences, and organs. In this study, we present ImT-MRD: a complex-valued imaging transformer trained on a vast number of clinical MRI scans aiming at universal MR denoising at LF systems. Compared with averaging multiple-repeated scans for higher image SNR, the model obtains better image quality from fewer repetitions, demonstrating its capability for accelerating scans under various clinical settings. Moreover, with its complex-valued image input, the model can denoise intermediate results before advanced post-processing and prepare high-quality data for further MRI research. By delivering universal and accurate denoising across clinical and research tasks, our model holds great promise to expedite the evolution of LF MRI for accessible and equal biomedical applications.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Proximity detection in indoor environments based on WiFi signals has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing works rely on the dynamic signal reflections and their extracted features are dependent on motion strength. To address this issue, we design a robust WiFi-based proximity detector by considering gait monitoring. Specifically, we propose a gait score that accurately evaluates gait presence by leveraging the speed estimated from the autocorrelation function (ACF) of channel state information (CSI). By combining this gait score with a proximity feature, our approach effectively distinguishes different transition patterns, enabling more reliable proximity detection. In addition, to enhance the stability of the detection process, we employ a state machine and extract temporal information, ensuring continuous proximity detection even during subtle movements. Extensive experiments conducted in different environments demonstrate an overall detection rate of 92.5% and a low false alarm rate of 1.12% with a delay of 0.825s.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Ensuring safety is the most important factor in connected and autonomous vehicles, especially in emergency braking situations. As such, assessing the safety benefits of one information topology over other is a necessary step towards evaluating and ensuring safety. In this paper, we compare the safety benefits of a cooperative adaptive cruise control which utilizes information from one predecessor vehicle (CACC) with the one that utilizes information from multiple predecessors (CACC+) for the maintenance of spacing under an emergency braking scenario. A constant time headway policy is employed for maintenance of spacing (that includes a desired standstill spacing distance and a velocity dependent spacing distance) between the vehicles in the platoon. The considered emergency braking scenario consists of braking of the leader vehicle of the platoon at its maximum deceleration and that of the following vehicles to maintain the spacing as per CACC or CACC+. By focusing on the standstill spacing distance and utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the safety benefits of CACC+ over CACC by utilizing the following safety metrics: (1) probability of collision, (2) expected number of collisions, and (3) severity of collision (defined as the relative velocity of the two vehicles at impact). We present and provide discussion of these results.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Efficient thermal management in high-power electronics cooling can be achieved using phase-change heat transfer devices, such as vapor chambers. Traditional vapor chambers use wicks to transport condensate for efficient thermal exchange and to prevent "dry-out" of the evaporator. However, wicks in vapor chambers present significant design challenges arising out of large pressure drops across the wicking material, which slows down condensate transport rates and increases the chances for dry-out. Thicker wicks add to overall thermal resistance, while deterring the development of thinner devices by limiting the total thickness of the vapor chamber. Wickless vapor chambers eliminate the use of metal wicks entirely, by incorporating complementary wettability-patterned flat plates on both the evaporator and the condenser side. Such surface modifications enhance fluid transport on the evaporator side, while allowing the chambers to be virtually as thin as imaginable, thereby permitting design of thermally efficient thin electronic cooling devices. While wick-free vapor chambers have been studied and efficient design strategies have been suggested, we delve into real-life applications of wick-free vapor chambers in forced air cooling of high-power electronics. An experimental setup is developed wherein two Si-based MOSFETs of TO-247-3 packaging having high conduction resistance, are connected in parallel and switched at 100 kHz, to emulate high frequency power electronics operations. A rectangular copper wick-free vapor chamber spreads heat laterally over a surface 13 times larger than the heating area. This chamber is cooled externally by a fan that circulates air at room temperature. The present experimental setup extends our previous work on wick-free vapor chambers, while demonstrating the effectiveness of low-cost air cooling in vapor-chamber enhanced high-power electronics applications.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">The popularity of mobile vision creates a demand for advanced compact computational imaging systems, which call for the development of both a lightweight optical system and an effective image reconstruction model. Recently, joint design pipelines come to the research forefront, where the two significant components are simultaneously optimized via data-driven learning to realize the optimal system design. However, the effectiveness of these designs largely depends on the initial setup of the optical system, complicated by a non-convex solution space that impedes reaching a globally optimal solution. In this work, we present Global Search Optics (GSO) to automatically design compact computational imaging systems through two parts: (i) Fused Optimization Method for Automatic Optical Design (OptiFusion), which searches for diverse initial optical systems under certain design specifications; and (ii) Efficient Physic-aware Joint Optimization (EPJO), which conducts parallel joint optimization of initial optical systems and image reconstruction networks with the consideration of physical constraints, culminating in the selection of the optimal solution. Extensive experimental results on the design of three-piece (3P) sphere computational imaging systems illustrate that the GSO serves as a transformative end-to-end lens design paradigm for superior global optimal structure searching ability, which provides compact computational imaging systems with higher imaging quality compared to traditional methods.

       <p class="mathjax">We consider the notion of resilience for cyber-physical systems, that is, the ability of the system to withstand adverse events while maintaining acceptable functionality. We use finite temporal logic to express the requirements on the acceptable functionality and define the resilience metric as the maximum disturbance under which the system satisfies the temporal requirements. We fix a parameterized template for the set of disturbances and form a robust optimization problem under the system dynamics and the temporal specifications to find the maximum value of the parameter. Additionally, we introduce two novel classes of specifications: closed and convex finite temporal logics specifications, offering a comprehensive analysis of the resilience metric within these specific frameworks. From a computational standpoint, we present an exact solution for linear systems and exact-time reachability and finite-horizon safety, complemented by an approximate solution for finite-horizon reachability. Extending our findings to nonlinear systems, we leverage linear approximations and SMT-based approaches to offer viable computational methodologies. The theoretical results are demonstrated on the temperature regulation of buildings, adaptive cruise control and DC motors.</p>

To date, reported transitions either have high loss, typically 3 to 4 dB, or require high cost packages to support very fine bump pitches and low loss materials. We analyze the impact of transitions on a high frequency, wide bandwidth communication system and present the design of a chip-to-package transition in two different commercial packaging technologies. The proposed transitions achieve &lt;1 dB loss in both technologies, validating the design methodology.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technology holds the potential to revolutionize head-mounted displays (HMDs) by enabling high-speed wireless communication with nearby processing nodes, where complex video rendering can take place. However, the sparse angular profile of mmWave channels, coupled with the narrow field of view (FoV) of patch-antenna arrays and frequent HMD rotation, can lead to poor performance. <br>
        We introduce six channel performance metrics to evaluate the performance of an HMD equipped with mmWave arrays. We analyze the metrics using analytical models, discuss their impact for the application, and apply them to 28 GHz channel sounding data, collected in a conference room using eight HMD patch-antenna arrays, offset by 45 degrees from each other in azimuth. <br>
        Our findings confirm that a single array performs poorly due to the narrow FoV, and featuring multiple arrays along the HMD's azimuth is required. Namely, the broader FoV stabilizes channel gain during HMD rotation, lessens the attenuation caused by line of sight (LoS) obstruction, and increases the channel's spatial multiplexing capability. In light of our findings, we conclude that it is imperative to either equip the HMD with multiple arrays or, as an alternative approach, incorporate macroscopic diversity by leveraging distributed access point (AP) infrastructure.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">As simulation is increasingly used in scenario-based approaches to test Automated Driving Systems, the credibility of simulation results is a major concern. Arguably, credibility depends on the validity of the simulation setup and simulation models. When selecting appropriate simulation models, a trade-off must be made between validity, often connected to the model's fidelity, and cost of computation. However, due to the large number of test cases, expert-based methods to create sufficiently valid simulation setups seem infeasible. We propose using design contracts in order to semi-automatically compose simulation setups for given test cases from simulation models and to derive requirements for the simulation models, supporting separation of concerns between simulation model developers and users. Simulation model contracts represent their validity domains by capturing a validity guarantee and the associated operating conditions in an assumption. We then require the composition of the simulation model contracts to refine a test case contract. The latter contract captures the operating conditions of the test case in its assumption and validity requirements in its guarantee. Based on this idea, we present a framework that supports the compositional configuration of simulation setups based on the contracts and a method to derive runtime monitors for these simulation setups.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Ensuring intelligible speech communication for hearing assistive devices in low-latency scenarios presents significant challenges in terms of speech enhancement, coding and transmission. In this paper, we propose novel solutions for low-latency joint speech transmission and enhancement, leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs). Our approach integrates two state-of-the-art DNN architectures for low-latency speech enhancement and low-latency analog joint source-channel-based transmission, creating a combined low-latency system and jointly training both systems in an end-to-end approach. Due to the computational demands of the enhancement system, this order is suitable when high computational power is unavailable in the decoder, like hearing assistive devices. The proposed system enables the configuration of total latency, achieving high performance even at latencies as low as 3 ms, which is typically challenging to attain. The simulation results provide compelling evidence that a joint enhancement and transmission system is superior to a simple concatenation system in diverse settings, encompassing various wireless channel conditions, latencies, and background noise scenarios.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">As a critical component of modern infrastructure, data centers account for a huge amount of power consumption and greenhouse gas emission. This paper studies the electricity purchase strategy for a data center to lower its energy cost while integrating local renewable generation under uncertainty. To facilitate efficient and scalable decision-making, we propose a two-layer hierarchy where the lower layer consists of the operation of all electrical equipment in the data center and the upper layer determines the procurement and dispatch of electricity. At the lower layer, instead of device-level scheduling in real time, we propose to exploit the inherent flexibility in demand, such as thermostatically controlled loads and flexible computing tasks, and aggregate them into virtual batteries. By this means, the upper-layer decision only needs to take into account these virtual batteries, the size of which is generally small and independent of the data center scale. We further propose an online algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization to purchase electricity from the grid with a manageable energy cost, even though the prices, renewable availability, and battery specifications are uncertain and dynamic. In particular, we show that, under mild conditions, our algorithm can achieve bounded loss compared with the offline optimal cost, while strictly respecting battery operational constraints. Extensive simulation studies validate the theoretical analysis and illustrate the tradeoff between optimality and conservativeness.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a two-stage robust planning model for an Integrated Energy System (IES) that serves an industrial park. The term 'Park-level IES' is used to refers to IES of a smaller scale but have high demands for various forms of energy. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a novel and modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed models over the deterministic planning model in terms of improving reliability.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper presents a novel approach to achieving secure wireless communication by leveraging the inherent characteristics of wireless channels through end-to-end learning using a single-input-multiple-output (SIMO) autoencoder (AE). To ensure a more realistic signal transmission, we derive the signal model that captures all radio frequency (RF) hardware impairments to provide reliable and secure communication. Performance evaluations against traditional linear decoders, such as zero-forcing (ZR) and linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), and the optimal nonlinear decoder, maximum likelihood (ML), demonstrate that the AE-based SIMO model exhibits superior bit error rate (BER) performance, but with a substantial gap even in the presence of RF hardware impairments. Additionally, the proposed model offers enhanced security features, preventing potential eavesdroppers from intercepting transmitted information and leveraging RF impairments for augmented physical layer security and device identification. These findings underscore the efficacy of the proposed end-to-end learning approach in achieving secure and robust wireless communication.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Semantic communication technology is regarded as a method surpassing the Shannon limit of bit transmission, capable of effectively enhancing transmission efficiency. However, current approaches that directly map content to transmission symbols are challenging to deploy in practice, imposing significant limitations on the development of semantic communication. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid bit and semantic communication system, named HybridBSC, in which encoded semantic information is inserted into bit information for transmission via conventional digital communication systems utilizing same spectrum resources. The system can be easily deployed using existing communication architecture to achieve bit and semantic information transmission. Particularly, we design a semantic insertion and extraction scheme to implement this strategy. Furthermore, we conduct experimental validation based on the pluto-based software defined radio (SDR) platform in a real wireless channel, demonstrating that the proposed strategy can simultaneously transmit semantic and bit information.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper presents an innovative approach to intraoperative Optical Coherence Tomography (iOCT) image segmentation in ophthalmic surgery, leveraging statistical analysis of speckle patterns to incorporate statistical pathology-specific prior knowledge. Our findings indicate statistically different speckle patterns within the retina and between retinal layers and surgical tools, facilitating the segmentation of previously unseen data without the necessity for manual labeling. The research involves fitting various statistical distributions to iOCT data, enabling the differentiation of different ocular structures and surgical tools. The proposed segmentation model aims to refine the statistical findings based on prior tissue understanding to leverage statistical and biological knowledge. Incorporating statistical parameters, physical analysis of light-tissue interaction, and deep learning informed by biological structures enhance segmentation accuracy, offering potential benefits to real-time applications in ophthalmic surgical procedures. The study demonstrates the adaptability and precision of using Gamma distribution parameters and the derived binary maps as sole inputs for segmentation, notably enhancing the model's inference performance on unseen data.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In this paper, we consider the problem of voltage stability in DC networks containing uncertain loads with non-monotone incremental impedances and where the steady-state power availability is restricted to a subset of the buses in the network. We propose controllers for powered buses that guarantee voltage regulation and output strictly equilibrium independent passivity (OS-EIP) of the controlled buses, while buses without power are equipped with controllers that dampen their transient behaviour. The OS-EIP of a cluster containing both bus types is verified through a linear matrix inequality (LMI) condition, and the asymptotic stability of the overall microgrid with uncertain, non-monotone loads is ensured by interconnecting the OS-EIP clusters. By further employing singular perturbation theory, we show that the OS-EIP property of the clusters is robust against certain network parameter and topology changes.</p>

However, very few approaches consider the whole problem and proposed solutions are very often evaluated under very limited scenarios. We propose a fusion engine for localization that makes use of various data provided by a smartphone (Inertial sensors, pressure sensors, Wi-Fi, BLE, GNSS, map etc.) to provide a fused localization that is robust under harsh conditions (poor RSS coverage, device position change etc.). Moreover, our solution has been evaluated for hardware integration and tested over a large database including more than 250 experiments representing different scenarios, showing feasibility of lightweight implementation and good results over various conditions.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper develops an adaptive traffic control policy inspired by Maximum Pressure (MP) while imposing coordination across intersections. The proposed Coordinated Maximum Pressure-plus-Penalty (CMPP) control policy features a local objective for each intersection that consists of the total pressure within the neighborhood and a penalty accounting for the queue capacities and continuous green time for certain movements. The corresponding control task is reformulated as a distributed optimization problem and solved via two customized algorithms: one based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the other follows a greedy heuristic augmented with a majority vote. CMPP not only provides a theoretical guarantee of queuing network stability but also outperforms several benchmark controllers in simulations on a large-scale real traffic network with lower average travel and waiting time per vehicle, as well as less network congestion. Furthermore, CPMM with the greedy algorithm enjoys comparable computational efficiency as fully decentralized controllers without significantly compromising the control performance, which highlights its great potential for real-world deployment.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">The application of deep learning models in medical diagnosis has showcased considerable efficacy in recent years. Nevertheless, a notable limitation involves the inherent lack of explainability during decision-making processes. This study addresses such a constraint, by enhancing the interpretability robustness. The primary focus is directed towards refining the explanations generated by the LIME Library and LIME image explainer. This is achieved throuhg post-processing mechanisms, based on scenario-specific rules. Multiple experiments have been conducted using publicly accessible datasets related to brain tumor detection. Our proposed post-heuristic approach demonstrates significant advancements, yielding more robust and concrete results, in the context of medical diagnosis.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">The reduction of overall system inertia in modern power systems due to the increasing deployment of distributed energy resources is generally recognized as a major issue for system stability. Consequently, real-time monitoring of system inertia is critical to ensure a reliable and cost-effective system operation. Large-scale power systems are typically managed by multiple transmission system operators, making it difficult to have a central entity with access to global measurement data, which is usually required for estimating the overall system inertia. We address this problem by proposing a fully distributed inertia estimation algorithm with rigorous analytical convergence guarantees. This method requires only peer-to-peer sharing of local parameter estimates between neighboring control areas, eliminating the need for a centralized collection of real-time measurements. We robustify the algorithm in the presence of typical power system disturbances and demonstrate its performance in simulations based on the well-known New England IEEE-39 bus system.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Heart diseases are the main international cause of human defunction. According to the WHO, nearly 18 million people decease each year because of heart diseases. Also considering the increase of medical data, much pressure is put on the health industry to develop systems for early and accurate heart disease recognition. In this work, an automatic cardiac pathology recognition system based on a novel deep learning framework is proposed, which analyses in real-time echocardiography video sequences. The system works in two stages. The first one transforms the data included in a database of echocardiography sequences into a machine-learning-compatible collection of annotated images which can be used in the training stage of any kind of machine learning-based framework, and more specifically with deep learning. This includes the use of the Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) algorithm, for the first time to the authors' knowledge, for both data augmentation and feature extraction in the medical field. The second stage is focused on building and training a Vision Transformer (ViT), barely explored in the related literature. The ViT is adapted for an effective training from scratch, even with small datasets. The designed neural network analyses images from an echocardiography sequence to predict the heart state. The results obtained show the superiority of the proposed system and the efficacy of the HODMD algorithm, even outperforming pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are so far the method of choice in the literature.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been widely used in medicine, particularly in the analysis of medical imaging, which has been driven by advances in computer vision and deep learning methods. This is particularly important in overcoming the challenges posed by diseases such as Bone Metastases (BM), a common and complex malignancy of the bones. Indeed, there have been an increasing interest in developing Machine Learning (ML) techniques into oncologic imaging for BM analysis. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art and advancements for BM analysis using artificial intelligence, this review is conducted with the accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Firstly, this review highlights the clinical and oncologic perspectives of BM and the used medical imaging modalities, with discussing their advantages and limitations. Then the review focuses on modern approaches with considering the main BM analysis tasks, which includes: classification, detection and segmentation. The results analysis show that ML technologies can achieve promising performance for BM analysis and have significant potential to improve clinician efficiency and cope with time and cost limitations. Furthermore, there are requirements for further research to validate the clinical performance of ML tools and facilitate their integration into routine clinical practice.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In this work, we present X-Diffusion, a cross-sectional diffusion model tailored for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. X-Diffusion is capable of generating the entire MRI volume from just a single MRI slice or optionally from few multiple slices, setting new benchmarks in the precision of synthesized MRIs from extremely sparse observations. The uniqueness lies in the novel view-conditional training and inference of X-Diffusion on MRI volumes, allowing for generalized MRI learning. Our evaluations span both brain tumour MRIs from the BRATS dataset and full-body MRIs from the UK Biobank dataset. Utilizing the paired pre-registered Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and MRI modalities in the UK Biobank dataset, X-Diffusion is able to generate detailed 3D MRI volume from a single full-body DXA. Remarkably, the resultant MRIs not only stand out in precision on unseen examples (surpassing state-of-the-art results by large margins) but also flawlessly retain essential features of the original MRI, including tumour profiles, spine curvature, brain volume, and beyond. Furthermore, the trained X-Diffusion model on the MRI datasets attains a generalization capacity out-of-domain (e.g. generating knee MRIs even though it is trained on brains). The code is available on the project website https://emmanuelleb985.github.io/XDiffusion/ .</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper investigates the radio resource management (RRM) design for multiuser rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), accounting for various characteristics of practical wireless systems, such as the use of discrete rates, the inability to serve all users, and the imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC). Specifically, failure to consider these characteristics in RRM design may lead to inefficient use of radio resources. Therefore, we formulate the RRM of RSMA as optimization problems to maximize respectively the weighted sum rate (WSR) and weighted energy efficiency (WEE), and jointly optimize the beamforming, user admission, discrete/continuous rates, accounting for imperfect SIC, which result in nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programs that are challenging to solve. Despite the difficulty of the optimization problems, we develop algorithms that can find high-quality solutions. We show via simulations that carefully accounting for the aforementioned characteristics, can lead to significant gains. Precisely, by considering that transmission rates are discrete, the transmit power can be utilized more intelligently, allocating just enough power to guarantee a given discrete rate. Additionally, we reveal that user admission plays a crucial role in RSMA, enabling additional gains compared to random admission by facilitating the servicing of selected users with mutually beneficial channel characteristics. Furthermore, provisioning for possibly imperfect SIC makes RSMA more robust and reliable.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Interconnecting power converters (IPC) are the main elements enabling the interconnection of multiple high-voltage alternating current (HVAC) and high-voltage direct current (HVDC) subgrids. These converters can be classified either as grid-forming or grid-following. These roles can be assigned to both ac and dc terminals. This work compares state-of-the-art single-port grid-forming and grid-following control schemes with a dual-port grid-forming control scheme, which can simultaneously form a stable voltage on the ac and the dc sides. The dual-port grid-forming small-signal stability and dynamic behavior under fluctuations in the power flow are studied and compared against state-of-the-art control architectures. Moreover, the dual-port control scheme is validated and tested on a down-scaled laboratory platform with several transient events.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is attracting more and more research interest because of its ability to reprogram the radio environment. Designing and implementing the RIS, however, is challenging because of limitations of printed circuit board (PCB) technology related to manufacturing of large sizes as well as the cost of switches. Thus, a low-cost manufacturing process suitable for large size and volume of devices, such as screen-printing is necessary. In this paper, for the first time, a fully screen-printed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with vanadium dioxide (VO2) switches for 5G and beyond communications is proposed. A VO2 ink has been prepared and batches of switches have been printed and integrated with the resonator elements. These switches are a fraction of the cost of commercial switches. Furthermore, the printing of these switches directly on metal patterns negates the need of any minute soldering of the switches. To avoid the complications of multilayer printing and realizing the RIS without vias, the resonators and the biasing lines are realized on a single layer. However, this introduces the challenge of interference between the biasing lines and the resonators, which is tackled in this work by designing the bias lines as part of the resonator. By adjusting the unit cell periodicity and the dimension of the H-shaped resonator, we achieve a 220 to 170{\deg} phase shift from 23.5 GHz to 29.5 GHz covering both n257 and n258 bands. Inside the wide bandwidth, the maximum ON reflection magnitude is 74%, and the maximum OFF magnitude is 94%. The RIS array comprises 20x20 unit cells (4.54x4.54{\lambda}^2 at 29.5 GHz). Each column of unit cells is serially connected to a current biasing circuit. To validate the array's performance, we conduct full-wave simulations as well as near-field and far-field measurements.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Recent popular decoder-only text-to-speech models are known for their ability of generating natural-sounding speech. However, such models sometimes suffer from word skipping and repeating due to the lack of explicit monotonic alignment constraints. In this paper, we notice from the attention maps that some particular attention heads of the decoder-only model indicate the alignments between speech and text. We call the attention maps of those heads Alignment-Emerged Attention Maps (AEAMs). Based on this discovery, we propose a novel inference method without altering the training process, named Attention-Constrained Inference (ACI), to facilitate monotonic synthesis. It first identifies AEAMs using the Attention Sweeping algorithm and then applies constraining masks on AEAMs. Our experimental results on decoder-only TTS model VALL-E show that the WER of synthesized speech is reduced by up to 20.5% relatively with ACI while the naturalness and speaker similarity are comparable.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">The multi-plane phase retrieval method provides a budget-friendly and effective way to perform phase imaging, yet it often encounters alignment challenges due to shifts along the optical axis in experiments. Traditional methods, such as employing beamsplitters instead of mechanical stage movements or adjusting focus using tunable light sources, add complexity to the setup required for multi-plane phase retrieval. Attempts to address these issues computationally face difficulties due to the variable impact of diffraction, which renders conventional homography techniques inadequate. In our research, we introduce a novel Adaptive Cascade Calibrated (ACC) strategy for multi-plane phase retrieval that overcomes misalignment issues. This technique detects feature points within the refocused sample space and calculates the transformation matrix for neighboring planes on-the-fly to digitally adjust measurements, facilitating alignment-free multi-plane phase retrieval. This approach not only avoids the need for complex and expensive optical hardware but also simplifies the imaging setup, reducing overall costs. The effectiveness of our method is validated through simulations and real-world optical experiments.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This study explores the impact of whole-body vibrations induced by external vehicle perturbations, such as aircraft turbulence, on the perception of electrovibration displayed on touchscreens. Electrovibration holds promise as a technology for providing tactile feedback on future touchscreens, addressing usability challenges in vehicle cockpits. However, its performance under dynamic conditions, such as during whole-body vibrations induced by turbulence, still needs to be explored. We measured the absolute detection thresholds of 15 human participants for short- and long-duration electrovibration stimuli displayed on a touchscreen, both in the absence and presence of two types of turbulence motion generated by a motion simulator. Concurrently, we measured participants' applied contact force and finger scan speeds. Significantly higher (38%) absolute detection thresholds were observed for short electrovibration stimuli than for long stimuli. Finger scan speeds in the direction of turbulence, applied forces, and force fluctuation rates increased during whole-body vibrations due to biodynamic feedthrough. As a result, turbulence also significantly increased the perception thresholds, but only for short-duration electrovibration stimuli. The results reveal that whole-body vibrations can impede the perception of short-duration electrovibration stimuli, due to involuntary finger movements and increased normal force fluctuations. Our findings offer valuable insights for the future design of touchscreens with tactile feedback in vehicle cockpits.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">We investigate the age of information (AoI) in a scenario where energy-harvesting devices send status updates to a gateway following the slotted ALOHA protocol and receive no feedback. We let the devices adjust the transmission probabilities based on their current battery level. Using a Markovian analysis, we derive analytically the average AoI. We further provide an approximate analysis for accurate and easy-to-compute approximations of both the average AoI and the age-violation probability (AVP), i.e., the probability that the AoI exceeds a given threshold. We also analyze the average throughput. Via numerical results, we investigate two baseline strategies: transmit a new update whenever possible to exploit every opportunity to reduce the AoI, and transmit only when sufficient energy is available to increase the chance of successful decoding. The two strategies are beneficial for low and high update-generation rates, respectively. We show that an optimized policy that balances the two strategies outperforms them significantly in terms of both AoI metrics and throughput. Finally, we show the benefit of decoding multiple packets in a slot using successive interference cancellation and adapting the transmission probability based on both the current battery level and the time elapsed since the last transmission.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">We consider the problem of inferring the conditional independence graph (CIG) of a sparse, high-dimensional, stationary matrix-variate Gaussian time series. All past work on high-dimensional matrix graphical models assumes that independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations of the matrix-variate are available. Here we allow dependent observations. We consider a sparse-group lasso-based frequency-domain formulation of the problem with a Kronecker-decomposable power spectral density (PSD), and solve it via an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach. The problem is bi-convex which is solved via flip-flop optimization. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence in the Frobenius norm of the inverse PSD estimators to the true value. This result also yields a rate of convergence. We illustrate our approach using numerical examples utilizing both synthetic and real data.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Ambient Internet of Things networks use low-cost, low-power backscatter tags in various industry applications. By exploiting those tags, we introduce the integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) system, featuring multiple backscatter tags, a user (reader), and a full-duplex base station (BS) that integrates sensing and (backscatter) communications. The BS undertakes dual roles of detecting backscatter tags and communicating with the user, leveraging the same temporal and frequency resources. The tag-reflected BS signals offer data to the user and enable the BS to sense the environment simultaneously. We derive both user and tag communication rates and the sensing rate of the BS. We jointly optimize the transmit/received beamformers and tag reflection coefficients to minimize the total BS power. To solve this problem, we employ the alternating optimization technique. We offer a closed-form solution for the received beamformers while utilizing semi-definite relaxation and slack-optimization for transmit beamformers and power reflection coefficients, respectively. For example, with ten transmit/reception antennas at the BS, ISABC delivers a 75% sum communication and sensing rates gain over a traditional backscatter while requiring a 3.4% increase in transmit power. Furthermore, ISABC with active tags only requires a 0.24% increase in transmit power over conventional integrated sensing and communication.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Star trackers are one of the most accurate celestial sensors used for absolute attitude determination. The devices detect stars in captured images and accurately compute their projected centroids on an imaging focal plane with subpixel precision. Traditional algorithms for star detection and centroiding often rely on threshold adjustments for star pixel detection and pixel brightness weighting for centroid computation. However, challenges like high sensor noise and stray light can compromise algorithm performance. This article introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for star detection and centroiding, tailored to address the issues posed by noisy star tracker images in the presence of stray light and other artifacts. Trained using simulated star images overlayed with real sensor noise and stray light, the CNN produces both a binary segmentation map distinguishing star pixels from the background and a distance map indicating each pixel's proximity to the nearest star centroid. Leveraging this distance information alongside pixel coordinates transforms centroid calculations into a set of trilateration problems solvable via the least squares method. Our method employs efficient UNet variants for the underlying CNN architectures, and the variants' performances are evaluated. Comprehensive testing has been undertaken with synthetic image evaluations, hardware-in-the-loop assessments, and night sky tests. The tests consistently demonstrated that our method outperforms several existing algorithms in centroiding accuracy and exhibits superior resilience to high sensor noise and stray light interference. An additional benefit of our algorithms is that they can be executed in real-time on low-power edge AI processors.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">This paper tackles the problem of designing proper uplink multiple access (MA) schemes for coexistence between enhanced mobile broadband+ (eMBB+) users and massive machine-type communications+ (mMTC+) devices in a terminal-centric cell-free massive MIMO system. Specifically, the use of a time-frequency spreading technique for the mMTC+ devices has been proposed. Coupled with the assumption of imperfect channel knowledge, closed-form bounds of the achievable (ergodic) rate for the two types of data services are derived. Using suitable power control mechanisms, we show it is possible to efficiently multiplex eMBB+ and mMTC+ traffic in the same time-frequency resource grid. Numerical experiments reveal interesting trade-offs in the selection of the spreading gain and the number of serving access points within the system. Results also demonstrate that the performance of the mMTC+ devices is slightly affected by the presence of the eMBB+ users. Overall, our approach can endow good quality of service to both 6G cornerstones at once.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Singing voice beautifying is a novel task that has application value in people's daily life, aiming to correct the pitch of the singing voice and improve the expressiveness without changing the original timbre and content. Existing methods rely on paired data or only concentrate on the correction of pitch. However, professional songs and amateur songs from the same person are hard to obtain, and singing voice beautifying doesn't only contain pitch correction but other aspects like emotion and rhythm. Since we propose a fast and high-fidelity singing voice beautifying system called ConTuner, a diffusion model combined with the modified condition to generate the beautified Mel-spectrogram, where the modified condition is composed of optimized pitch and expressiveness. For pitch correction, we establish a mapping relationship from MIDI, spectrum envelope to pitch. To make amateur singing more expressive, we propose the expressiveness enhancer in the latent space to convert amateur vocal tone to professional. ConTuner achieves a satisfactory beautification effect on both Mandarin and English songs. Ablation study demonstrates that the expressiveness enhancer and generator-based accelerate method in ConTuner are effective.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">The ever-increasing need for power consumption in electronic devices, coupled with the requirement for thinner size, calls for the development of efficient heat spreading components. Vapor chambers (VCs), because of their ability to effectively spread heat over a large area by two-phase heat transfer, seem ideal for such applications. However, creating thin and efficient vapor chambers that work over a wide range of power inputs is a persisting challenge. VCs that use wicks for circulating the phase changing media, suffer from capillary restrictions, dry-out, clogging, increase in size and weight, and can often be costly. Recent developments in wick-free wettability patterned vapor chambers replace traditional wicks with laser-fabricated wickless components. An experimental setup allows for fast testing and experimental evaluation of water-charged VCs with liquid-assisted cooling. The sealed chamber can maintain vacuum for long durations, and can be used for testing of very thin wick-free VCs. This work extends our previous study by decreasing overall thickness of the wick-free VC down to 3 mm and evaluates its performance. Furthermore, the impact of wettability patterns on VC performance is investigated, by carrying out experiments both in non-patterned and patterned VCs. Experiments are first carried out on a wick-free VC with no wettability patterns and comprising of an entirely superhydrophilic evaporator coupled with a hydrophobic condenser. Thereafter, wettability patterns that aid the rapid return of water to the heated site on the evaporator and improve condensation on the condenser of the vapor chamber are implemented. The thermal characteristics show that the patterned VCs outperform the non-patterned VCs under all scenarios. The patterned VCs exhibit low thermal resistance independent of fluid charging ratio withstanding higher power inputs without thermal dry-outs.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Exploring novel strategies for the regulation of axon growth, we introduce a periodic event-triggered control (PETC) to enhance the practical implementation of the associated PDE backstepping control law. Neurological injuries may impair neuronal function, but therapies like Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) have shown promise in improving axon elongation by influencing the extracellular matrix. This matrix, composed of extracellular macromolecules and minerals, regulates tubulin protein concentration, potentially aiding in neuronal recovery. The concentration and spatial distribution of tubulin influence axon elongation dynamics. Recent research explores feedback control strategies for this model, leading to the development of an event-triggering control (CETC) approach. In this approach, the control law updates when the monitored triggering condition is met, reducing actuation resource consumption. Through the meticulous redesign of the triggering mechanism, we introduce a periodic event-triggering control (PETC), updating control inputs at specific intervals, but evaluating the event-trigger only periodically, an ideal tool for standard time-sliced actuators like ChABC. PETC is a step forward to the design of practically feasible feedback laws for the neuron growth process. The PETC strategy establishes an upper bound on event triggers between periodic examinations, ensuring convergence and preventing Zeno behavior. Through Lyapunov analysis, we demonstrate the local exponential convergence of the system with the periodic event-triggering mechanism in the $L^2$-norm sense. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical findings.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Using unsupervised learning to disentangle speech into content, rhythm, pitch, and timbre for voice conversion has become a hot research topic. Existing works generally take into account disentangling speech components through human-crafted bottleneck features which can not achieve sufficient information disentangling, while pitch and rhythm may still be mixed together. There is a risk of information overlap in the disentangling process which results in less speech naturalness. To overcome such limits, we propose a two-stage model to disentangle speech representations in a self-supervised manner without a human-crafted bottleneck design, which uses the Mutual Information (MI) with the designed upper bound estimator (IFUB) to separate overlapping information between speech components. Moreover, we design a Joint Text-Guided Consistent (TGC) module to guide the extraction of speech content and eliminate timbre leakage issues. Experiments show that our model can achieve a better performance than the baseline, regarding disentanglement effectiveness, speech naturalness, and similarity.

       <p class="mathjax">In recent years, Transformer networks have shown remarkable performance in speech recognition tasks. However, their deployment poses challenges due to high computational and storage resource requirements. To address this issue, a lightweight model called EfficientASR is proposed in this paper, aiming to enhance the versatility of Transformer models. EfficientASR employs two primary modules: Shared Residual Multi-Head Attention (SRMHA) and Chunk-Level Feedforward Networks (CFFN). The SRMHA module effectively reduces redundant computations in the network, while the CFFN module captures spatial knowledge and reduces the number of parameters. The effectiveness of the EfficientASR model is validated on two public datasets, namely Aishell-1 and HKUST. Experimental results demonstrate a 36% reduction in parameters compared to the baseline Transformer network, along with improvements of 0.3% and 0.2% in Character Error Rate (CER) on the Aishell-1 and HKUST datasets, respectively.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Nash equilibrium is a common solution concept that captures the strategic interaction in electricity market analysis. However, it requires a fundamental but impractical assumption that all market participants are fully rational, which implies unlimited computational resources and cognitive abilities. To tackle the limitation, level-k reasoning is proposed and studied to model the bounded rational behaviors. In this paper, we consider a Cournot competition in electricity markets with two suppliers both following level-k reasoning. One is a self-interested firm and the other serves as a benevolent social planner. First, we observe that the optimal strategy of the social planner is to be of a particular rationality level. Being less or more rational may both result in reduced social welfare. Then, we investigate the effect of bounded rationality on social welfare performance and find that it could largely deviate from that at the Nash equilibrium point. Finally, we characterize optimal, mean maximizing and max-min strategies for the benevolent social planner, when having access to different information. The numerical experiments further demonstrate and validate our findings.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Depth position highly affects lens distortion, especially in close-range photography, which limits the measurement accuracy of existing stereo vision systems. Moreover, traditional depth-dependent distortion models and their calibration methods have remained complicated. In this work, we propose a minimal set of parameters based depth-dependent distortion model (MDM), which considers the radial and decentering distortions of the lens to improve the accuracy of stereo vision systems and simplify their calibration process. In addition, we present an easy and flexible calibration method for the MDM of stereo vision systems with a commonly used planar pattern, which requires cameras to observe the planar pattern in different orientations. The proposed technique is easy to use and flexible compared with classical calibration techniques for depth-dependent distortion models in which the lens must be perpendicular to the planar pattern. The experimental validation of the MDM and its calibration method showed that the MDM improved the calibration accuracy by 56.55% and 74.15% compared with the Li's distortion model and traditional Brown's distortion model. Besides, an iteration-based reconstruction method is proposed to iteratively estimate the depth information in the MDM during three-dimensional reconstruction. The results showed that the accuracy of the iteration-based reconstruction method was improved by 9.08% compared with that of the non-iteration reconstruction method.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Controlling quantum systems under correlated non-Markovian noise, particularly when strongly coupled, poses significant challenges in the development of quantum technologies. Traditional quantum control strategies, heavily reliant on precise models, often fail under these conditions. Here, we address the problem by utilizing a data-driven graybox model, which integrates machine learning structures with physics-based elements. We demonstrate single-qubit control, implementing a universal gate set as well as a random gate set, achieving high fidelity under unknown, strongly-coupled non-Markovian non-Gaussian noise, significantly outperforming traditional methods. Our method is applicable to all open finite-dimensional quantum systems, regardless of the type of noise or the strength of the coupling.</p>

The first one is the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm, and the second one is a symplectic integrator constructed through discretization maps. In particular, we choose the cases of $n=3$ together with $k=1$ and $k=2$. The first case is diffeomorphic to the sphere and the quasi-geodesics appearing in the adjusted de Casteljau algorithm are actually geodesics. The second case is an example where we have a pure quasi-geodesic different from a geodesic. We provide a numerical comparison of both methods and discuss the obtained results to highlight the benefits of each method.</p>

By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Existing neural audio codecs usually sacrifice computational complexity for audio quality. They build the feature transformation layers mainly on convolutional blocks, which are not inherently appropriate for capturing local redundancies of audio signals. As compensation, either adversarial losses from a discriminator or a large number of model parameters are required to improve the codec. To that end, we propose Efficient Speech Codec (ESC), a lightweight parameter-efficient codec laid on cross-scale residual vector quantization and transformers. Our model leverages mirrored hierarchical window-attention transformer blocks and performs step-wise decoding from coarse-to-fine feature representations. To enhance codebook utilization, we design a learning paradigm that involves a pre-training stage to assist with codec training. Extensive results show that ESC can achieve high audio quality with much lower complexity, which is a prospective alternative in place of existing codecs.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Brain responses related to working memory originate from distinct brain areas and oscillate at different frequencies. EEG signals with high temporal correlation can effectively capture these responses. Therefore, estimating the functional connectivity of EEG for working memory protocols in different frequency bands plays a significant role in analyzing the brain dynamics with increasing memory and cognitive loads, which remains largely unexplored. The present study introduces a Bayesian structure learning algorithm to learn the functional connectivity of EEG in sensor space. Next, the functional connectivity graphs are taken as input to the graph convolutional network to classify the working memory loads. The intrasubject (subject-specific) classification performed on 154 subjects for six different verbal working memory loads produced the highest classification accuracy of 96% and average classification accuracy of 89%, outperforming state-of-the-art classification models proposed in the literature. Furthermore, the proposed Bayesian structure learning algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art functional connectivity estimation methods through intersubject and intrasubject statistical analysis of variance. The results also show that the alpha and theta bands have better classification accuracy than the beta band.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Blind face restoration (BFR) on images has significantly progressed over the last several years, while real-world video face restoration (VFR), which is more challenging for more complex face motions such as moving gaze directions and facial orientations involved, remains unsolved. Typical BFR methods are evaluated on privately synthesized datasets or self-collected real-world low-quality face images, which are limited in their coverage of real-world video frames. In this work, we introduced new real-world datasets named FOS with a taxonomy of "Full, Occluded, and Side" faces from mainly video frames to study the applicability of current methods on videos. Compared with existing test datasets, FOS datasets cover more diverse degradations and involve face samples from more complex scenarios, which helps to revisit current face restoration approaches more comprehensively. Given the established datasets, we benchmarked both the state-of-the-art BFR methods and the video super resolution (VSR) methods to comprehensively study current approaches, identifying their potential and limitations in VFR tasks. In addition, we studied the effectiveness of the commonly used image quality assessment (IQA) metrics and face IQA (FIQA) metrics by leveraging a subjective user study. With extensive experimental results and detailed analysis provided, we gained insights from the successes and failures of both current BFR and VSR methods. These results also pose challenges to current face restoration approaches, which we hope stimulate future advances in VFR research.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">While camera-based capture systems remain the gold standard for recording human motion, learning-based tracking systems based on sparse wearable sensors are gaining popularity. Most commonly, they use inertial sensors, whose propensity for drift and jitter have so far limited tracking accuracy. In this paper, we propose Ultra Inertial Poser, a novel 3D full body pose estimation method that constrains drift and jitter in inertial tracking via inter-sensor distances. We estimate these distances across sparse sensor setups using a lightweight embedded tracker that augments inexpensive off-the-shelf 6D inertial measurement units with ultra-wideband radio-based ranging$-$dynamically and without the need for stationary reference anchors. Our method then fuses these inter-sensor distances with the 3D states estimated from each sensor Our graph-based machine learning model processes the 3D states and distances to estimate a person's 3D full body pose and translation. To train our model, we synthesize inertial measurements and distance estimates from the motion capture database AMASS. For evaluation, we contribute a novel motion dataset of 10 participants who performed 25 motion types, captured by 6 wearable IMU+UWB trackers and an optical motion capture system, totaling 200 minutes of synchronized sensor data (UIP-DB). Our extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance for our method over PIP and TIP, reducing position error from $13.62$ to $10.65cm$ ($22\%$ better) and lowering jitter from $1.56$ to $0.055km/s^3$ (a reduction of $97\%$).</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Despite great success in modeling visual perception, deep neural network based image quality assessment (IQA) still remains unreliable in real-world applications due to its vulnerability to adversarial perturbations and the inexplicit black-box structure. In this paper, we propose to build a trustworthy IQA model via Causal Perception inspired Representation Learning (CPRL), and a score reflection attack method for IQA model. More specifically, we assume that each image is composed of Causal Perception Representation (CPR) and non-causal perception representation (N-CPR). CPR serves as the causation of the subjective quality label, which is invariant to the imperceptible adversarial perturbations. Inversely, N-CPR presents spurious associations with the subjective quality label, which may significantly change with the adversarial perturbations. To extract the CPR from each input image, we develop a soft ranking based channel-wise activation function to mediate the causally sufficient (beneficial for high prediction accuracy) and necessary (beneficial for high robustness) deep features, and based on intervention employ minimax game to optimize. Experiments on four benchmark databases show that the proposed CPRL method outperforms many state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods and provides explicit model interpretation.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Robots interacting with humans must be safe, reactive and adapt online to unforeseen environmental and task changes. Achieving these requirements concurrently is a challenge as interactive planners lack formal safety guarantees, while safe motion planners lack flexibility to adapt. To tackle this, we propose a modular control architecture that generates both safe and reactive motion plans for human-robot interaction by integrating temporal logic-based discrete task level plans with continuous Dynamical System (DS)-based motion plans. We formulate a reactive temporal logic formula that enables users to define task specifications through structured language, and propose a planning algorithm at the task level that generates a sequence of desired robot behaviors while being adaptive to environmental changes. At the motion level, we incorporate control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions to compute stable and safe continuous motion plans for two types of robot behaviors: (i) complex, possibly periodic motions given by autonomous DS and (ii) time-critical tasks specified by Signal Temporal Logic~(STL). Our methodology is demonstrated on the Franka robot arm performing wiping tasks on a whiteboard and a mannequin that is compliant to human interactions and adaptive to environmental changes.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In this paper, we propose a highly efficient method to estimate an image's mean opinion score (MOS) from a single opinion score (SOS). Assuming that each SOS is the observed sample of a normal distribution and the MOS is its unknown expectation, the MOS inference is formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem, where the perceptual correlation of pairwise images is considered in modeling the likelihood of SOS. More specifically, by means of the quality-aware representations learned from the self-supervised backbone, we introduce a learnable relative quality measure to predict the MOS difference between two images. Then, the current image's maximum likelihood estimation towards MOS is represented by the sum of another reference image's estimated MOS and their relative quality. Ideally, no matter which image is selected as the reference, the MOS of the current image should remain unchanged, which is termed perceptual cons tancy constrained calibration (PC3). Finally, we alternatively optimize the relative quality measure's parameter and the current image's estimated MOS via backpropagation and Newton's method respectively. Experiments show that the proposed method is efficient in calibrating the biased SOS and significantly improves IQA model learning when only SOSs are available.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Filling cloudy pixels in multispectral satellite imagery is essential for accurate data analysis and downstream applications, especially for tasks which require time series data. To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In recent years, Event Sound Source Localization has been widely applied in various fields. Recent works typically relying on the contrastive learning framework show impressive performance. However, all work is based on large relatively simple datasets. It's also crucial to understand and analyze human behaviors (actions and interactions of people), voices, and sounds in chaotic events in many applications, e.g., crowd management, and emergency response services. In this paper, we apply the existing model to a more complex dataset, explore the influence of parameters on the model, and propose a semi-supervised improvement method SemiPL. With the increase in data quantity and the influence of label quality, self-supervised learning will be an unstoppable trend. The experiment shows that the parameter adjustment will positively affect the existing model. In particular, SSPL achieved an improvement of 12.2% cIoU and 0.56% AUC in Chaotic World compared to the results provided. The code is available at: https://github.com/ly245422/SSPL</p>

       <p class="mathjax">Although humans engaged in face-to-face conversation simultaneously communicate both verbally and non-verbally, methods for joint and unified synthesis of speech audio and co-speech 3D gesture motion from text are a new and emerging field. These technologies hold great promise for more human-like, efficient, expressive, and robust synthetic communication, but are currently held back by the lack of suitably large datasets, as existing methods are trained on parallel data from all constituent modalities. Inspired by student-teacher methods, we propose a straightforward solution to the data shortage, by simply synthesising additional training material. Specifically, we use unimodal synthesis models trained on large datasets to create multimodal (but synthetic) parallel training data, and then pre-train a joint synthesis model on that material. In addition, we propose a new synthesis architecture that adds better and more controllable prosody modelling to the state-of-the-art method in the field. Our results confirm that pre-training on large amounts of synthetic data improves the quality of both the speech and the motion synthesised by the multimodal model, with the proposed architecture yielding further benefits when pre-trained on the synthetic data.

       <p class="mathjax">Image quality assessment often relies on raw opinion scores provided by subjects in subjective experiments, which can be noisy and unreliable. To address this issue, postprocessing procedures such as ITU-R BT.500, ITU-T P.910, and ITU-T P.913 have been standardized to clean up the original opinion scores. These methods use annotator-based statistical priors, but they do not take into account extensive information about the image itself, which limits their performance in less annotated scenarios. Generally speaking, image quality datasets usually contain similar scenes or distortions, and it is inevitable for subjects to compare images to score a reasonable score when scoring. Therefore, In this paper, we proposed Subjective Image Quality Score Preprocessing Method perceptual similarity Subjective Preprocessing (PSP), which exploit the perceptual similarity between images to alleviate subjective bias in less annotated scenarios. Specifically, we model subjective scoring as a conditional probability model based on perceptual similarity with previously scored images, called subconscious reference scoring. The reference images are stored by a neighbor dictionary, which is obtained by a normalized vector dot-product based nearest neighbor search of the images' perceptual depth features. Then the preprocessed score is updated by the exponential moving average (EMA) of the subconscious reference scoring, called similarity regularized EMA. Our experiments on multiple datasets (LIVE, TID2013, CID2013) show that this method can effectively remove the bias of the subjective scores. Additionally, Experiments prove that the Preprocesed dataset can improve the performance of downstream IQA tasks very well.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">We consider an asynchronous decentralized learning system, which consists of a network of connected devices trying to learn a machine learning model without any centralized parameter server. The users in the network have their own local training data, which is used for learning across all the nodes in the network. The learning method consists of two processes, evolving simultaneously without any necessary synchronization. The first process is the model update, where the users update their local model via a fixed number of stochastic gradient descent steps. The second process is model mixing, where the users communicate with each other via randomized gossiping to exchange their models and average them to reach consensus. In this work, we investigate the staleness criteria for such a system, which is a sufficient condition for convergence of individual user models. We show that for network scaling, i.e., when the number of user devices $n$ is very large, if the gossip capacity of individual users scales as $\Omega(\log n)$, we can guarantee the convergence of user models in finite time. Furthermore, we show that the bounded staleness can only be guaranteed by any distributed opportunistic scheme by $\Omega(n)$ scaling.</p>

       <p class="mathjax">In this paper, the problem of spectral-efficient communication and computation resource allocation for distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) in industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) is investigated. In the considered model, multiple RISs are deployed to serve multiple users, while PSC adopts compute-then-transmit protocol to reduce the transmission data size. To support high-rate transmission, the semantic compression ratio, transmit power allocation, and distributed RISs deployment must be jointly considered. This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to maximize the sum semantic-aware transmission rate of the system under total transmit power, phase shift, RIS-user association, and semantic compression ratio constraints. To solve this problem, a many-to-many matching scheme is proposed to solve the RIS-user association subproblem, the semantic compression ratio subproblem is addressed following greedy policy, while the phase shift of RIS can be optimized using the tensor based beamforming. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</p>
